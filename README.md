# Basic React websites
Personal versions of projects based on [Bob Ziroll's React 19 tutorial](https://youtu.be/x4rFhThSX04?si=pfANzDPNmetzC76C)

## Getting started
To start any project go into a project folder and execute two commands:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
Feel free to use this code as a starting point and make your own modifications!
